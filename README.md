A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images.This project analyzes bleaching and healthy coral using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The study explores two different CNN architectures: AlexNet and MobileNet V2, to classify coral conditions effectively. I'm using Healthy and Bleached Corals Image Classification from Kaggle.com databases and from field studies. I'm using the Kaggle dataset from this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/healthy-and-bleached-corals-image-classification.

Coral is a marine organism that forms large reef structures in tropical ocean waters.Coral reefs serve as vital ecosystems, supporting marine biodiversity. Coral bleaching occurs when environmental stress, such as rising sea temperatures, causes corals to expel their symbiotic algae, leading to a loss of color and increased vulnerability.

The Classification between healthy and bleached coral is a great importance for marine biologist and ecologist in studying and monitoring coral health through automated classification. 

The primary goal of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient deep learning model for detecting and classifying coral conditions (bleached vs. healthy). By leveraging CNN architectures, this project aims to:

1. Training and validation Accuracy from Alexnet and Mobilenet V2 Architectures.

2. Training and validation Loss from Alexnet and Mobilenet V2 Architectures.

3. Comparing the Accuracy and Loss between two Architectures.

4. Making simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for testing.

5. Evaluating the results from both Architectures.
